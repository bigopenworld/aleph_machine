### Description
"Aleph Machine" is a JavaFX program which act as a client. It allows us to launch the "Aleph" discord bot  
made in golang that we provides. It is built with gradle.

### Features
* You can select the main.go file and then build it.
* You can run the .exe / .sh file that you built previously by locating it.

### How to use it
To use Aleph Machine, you just need to download the .jar file in out/artifacts/aleph_machine_jar/  
I will put a link to download it directly later. Then just launch it and then select by the 1st button  
the main.go file of the bot. After the build, select the .exe / .sh file it made and hit the "start aleph"  
button.
